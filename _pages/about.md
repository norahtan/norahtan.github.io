My name is Xinyu Tan (Ë∞≠Ê¨£Èõ®) and I also go by Norah. I am a second-year Ph.D. student at MIT Math, advised by [Peter Shor](https://math.mit.edu/~shor/) and [Aram Harrow](https://www.mit.edu/~aram/). In 2022, I graduated from Duke University with highest distinctions in both Mathematics and Computer Science, and I was fortunated to be advised by [Robert Calderbank](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/robert-calderbank) and [Jianfeng Lu](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jianfeng/index.html). 

I am currently interested in quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance (click [here](/images/CalderbankShor.jpeg) for a photo of "Calderbank-Shor-Norah"). Although seemingly unrelated, I also work a lot on unitary designs.
